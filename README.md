# Agricultural Yield and Temperature Correlation Analysis
## Overview
Agriculture, a sector deeply intertwined with climate conditions, is susceptible to the impacts of global temperature changes. This project delves into the intricate relationship between annual temperature variations and agricultural yields. Leveraging datasets from NASA GISS for temperature records and FAO for agricultural production data, the analysis seeks to unravel patterns, trends, and potential correlations that shed light on how shifts in climate may influence crop productivity.

## Data Loading and Transformation
The project commences with the acquisition and preprocessing of NASA GISS and FAO datasets. The GISS dataset provides monthly temperature variations, while the FAO dataset offers comprehensive information on crop yields across different regions and years. The data is meticulously cleaned, unwanted columns are removed, and missing values are addressed to ensure the datasets are ready for in-depth exploration.

## Visualization of Data
The visualization stage employs various plotting techniques to make sense of the data. Time series plots showcase the annual mean temperature variations and crop yields over the years. Scatter plots and regression analyses offer insights into the correlation between temperature and crop yield. Heatmaps are utilized to visualize the correlation matrix, providing a comprehensive overview of the relationships between different variables.

## Results
Through the visualizations, the project aims to uncover trends and patterns that highlight how changes in temperature may impact agricultural yields. The interactive plots allow for dynamic exploration, enabling users to select specific crops and observe the correlation trends between temperature and yield for individual crops.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project offers a nuanced understanding of the intricate relationship between temperature variations and agricultural productivity. By leveraging advanced data analysis and visualization techniques, it provides a platform for stakeholders and researchers to gain insights into potential climate change impacts on global food production. The project's findings contribute to the broader conversation on climate resilience in agriculture and may inform future strategies for sustainable food security.
