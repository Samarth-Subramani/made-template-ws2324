# Project Plan

## Title
Climate Change Impact on Agriculture 

## Main Question

Explore the correlation between temperature variations (from NASA GISS) and agricultural productivity (FAO data). 

## Description

Agriculture is one of the most crucial sectors of the global economy, providing food and sustenance for billions of people worldwide. However, climate change poses a significant threat to agricultural productivity, with rising temperatures and extreme weather events disrupting crop yields and jeopardizing food security. This project aims to investigate the impact of temperature changes on agricultural productivity by analyzing data from NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis and the FAO - Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis dataset
* Metadata URL: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/
* Data URL: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v4/graph_data/GISTEMP_Seasonal_Cycle_since_1880/graph.csv
* Data Type: CSV
 
This dataset provides global gridded temperature data since 1880. It includes monthly, annual, and decadal temperature anomalies, allowing for the assessment of long-term temperature trends and variations.

### Datasource2: FAO - Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
* Metadata URL: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data
* Data URL: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL
* Data Type: CSV
  
The FAO provides extensive data on agricultural production, including crop yields, trade statistics, and food security indicators. This dataset will be used to extract information on crop yields and relate them to temperature variations.
